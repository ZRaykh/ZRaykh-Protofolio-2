                Hello, I'm Zach. A teenager living in NYC and this is my photo archive website. Whether you are a client interested in my non-professional work,
                 a friend who just wants to admire my photography, or some stranger from the internet who stumbled upon here, hello! 
                Please note none of these photos are from my clients and were taken for the sake of personal enjoyment. 
                Therefore, you will find mostly nature here rather than event or people photography. 
                While the majority of my orders are of people or events, I find nature to be my favorite thing to photograph!
                All of this website was coded by me! You might find bits and pieces of my poetry here in the future, but for now this is just a photo archive site! 
                Feel free to download photos as you wish, just please site me if do you them commerically.
