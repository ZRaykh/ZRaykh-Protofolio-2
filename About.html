                Hello, I'm Zach, a teenage photographer living in New York City. As a South Brooklyn native, I fell in love with the city at an early age and have worked to capture its beauty. This website houses examples of my non-commerical photography and serves to showcase my work. Whether it is nature or the city, photography is a core part of my life. Any photos are free for non-commercial use; however, please cite me if you use my work. All photographs were taken and edited by me. All rights reserved.
